-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< EXAMPLE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- TODO: Remove the "--" from the below SELECT query and run the query
--    NOTE: When writing queries, make sure each one ends with a semi-colon

SELECT * FROM final_airbnb;



-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out how many rows are in the table "final_airbnb"
-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 146sys_configsys_config

select COUNT(id) From final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out the name of the host for "host_id" 63613
-- HINT: "Where" could it be?

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Patricia
Select host_name From final_airbnb where host_id = "63613";

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to just show the unique neighbourhoods listed
-- HINT: This is a "distinct" operation...

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 40 neighbourhoods listed
Select distinct neighbourhood from final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 4 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-- Find both the highest price listing and the lowest price listing, displaying the entire row for each
-- HINT: This can be two different queries.

-- FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Think about the results. Are the high and low prices outliers in this data set?

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Highest = 785, Lowest = 55
Select Max(price) from final_airbnb;
Select Min(price) from final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the average availability for all listings in the data set (using the availability_365 column)
-- HINT: Aggregates are more than just big rocks...

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 165.3904
Select Avg (availability_365) from final_airbnb;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 6 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find all listings that do NOT have a review
-- HINT: There are a few ways to go about this. Remember that an empty cell is "no value", but not necessarily NULL

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 6 rows
Select * from final_airbnb where NOT number_of_reviews > "0";

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 7 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the id of the listing with a room_type of "Private room" that has the most reviews 
-- HINT: Sorting is your friend!

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059
select id from final_airbnb where room_type = "Private room" order by number_of_reviews desc limit 1;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 8 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the most popular neighbourhood for listings 
-- HINT: Look for which neighbourhood appears most frequently in the neighbourhood column
-- HINT: You are creating "summary rows" for each neighbourhood, so you will just see one entry for each neighbourhood

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Williamsburg
-- INVESTIGATE: Should Williamsburg be crowned the most popular neighbourhood?
select neighbourhood,COUNT(*)AS name from final_airbnb GROUP BY neighbourhood ORDER BY name desc limit 1;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 9 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to discover which listing is the most popular using the reviews_per_month for all listings with a minimum_nights value of less than 7
-- HINT: Sorting is still your friend! So are constraints.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059
select id from final_airbnb where reviews_per_month OR minimum_nights < "7" order by reviews_per_month desc limit 1;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 10 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out which host has the most listings. 
-- Create a NEW column that will show a calculation for how many listings the host for each listing has in the table
-- Display the column using aliasing.
-- HINT: Work this one step at a time. See if you can find a way to just display the count of listings per host first.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: The Box House Hotel with 6 listings
select host_name, COUNT(*)AS Listings from final_airbnb GROUP BY host_name Order By Listings desc limit 1;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 11 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< WRAP UP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?
-- Write a few sentences and include them with your project submission in the README file 

-- apparently willamsburg has a really good sucess rate due to location and availbility. Pricing also does involve this because of how much profit you're making combined with the availibility. 
-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ** BONUS ** >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the the percent above or below each listing is compared to the average price for all listings.
-- HINT: No hints! It's a bonus for a reason :)
